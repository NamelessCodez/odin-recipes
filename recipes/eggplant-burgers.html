        <h1>Eggplant Burgers</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is the veggie burger supreme - the easiest and MOST ECONOMICAL burger of all. A single medium-sized eggplant (together with the usual trimmings) feeds a family of six. Use whatever types of cheese and burger toppings to suit your family's taste.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 eggplant, peeled and sliced into 3/4 inch rounds</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon margarine</li>
            <li>6 slices Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>6 hamburger buns, split</li>
            <li>6 leaves lettuce</li>
            <li>6 slices tomato</li>
            <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup dill pickle slices</li>
            <li>1 (20 ounce) bottle ketchup</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the eggplant slices on a plate, and cook in the microwave for about 5 minutes, or until the centers are cooked.</li>
            <li>Melt margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry eggplant slices until lightly toasted on each side, and place one slice of cheese onto each one. Cook until cheese has melted, and remove from the skillet.</li>
            <li>Place eggplant on hamburger buns, and allow each person to top with lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles, and dress with ketchup, mayonnaise and mustard.</li>
